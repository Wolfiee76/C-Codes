// TASK REQUIREMENTS!
// Write a program to read a list of products and their base prices from a TXT file, calculate the total price 
//for each productand display the one with the maximum total price on the screen.The file can contain
//the product information as separate lines of the form :
//Coca-cola   2.80
//Pepsi   3.15
//Hot - dog    13.99
//The total price of a product equals the base price plus a tax, where the tax is 25 % of the price and
//cannot exceed $3.
//All of the calculations should be performed by a class named Product, which should store a productâ€™s
//base priceand tax percentage, and implement a GetTotalPrice() method to calculateand return
//the total price.
